## Projects

- Text2LEGO (2023.12)
: A follow-up project of 'Make Anything with LEGO', combining the text to image part with the previous project. It generates images based on text prompts and creates LEGO designs based on them. I was responsible for the text to image generation part using the stable diffusion model.

- Make Anything With LEGO (2023.11)
: A project for creating LEGO designs based on images using the Stable Diffusion Upscale model, One-2-3-45 model, and Colouredvoxels2LDR algorithm. I was responsible for voxelizing 3D objects and converting those voxels into LEGO designs.
